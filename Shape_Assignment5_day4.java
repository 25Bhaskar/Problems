/*Write a program to create a class named shape. It should contain 2 methods, 
 * draw() and erase() that prints �Drawing Shape� and �Erasing Shape� respectively.
 * For this class, create three sub classes, Circle, Triangle and Square and each class should override the parent class functions - draw () and erase ().
 * The draw() method should print �Drawing Circle�, �Drawing Triangle� and �Drawing Square� respectively.
 * The erase() method should print �Erasing Circle�, �Erasing Triangle� and �Erasing Square� respectively.
 * Create objects of Circle, Triangle and Square in the following way and observe the polymorphic nature of the class by calling draw() and erase() method using each object.
 * Shape c=new Circle();
 * Shape t=new Triangle();
 * Shape s=new Square();
